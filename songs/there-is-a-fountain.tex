\[A]There is a fountain \[D]filled with blood
  Drawn \[A]from Immanuelâ€™s \[E]veins;
And \[A]sinners, plunged be\[D]neath that flood,
  Lose \[A]all their \[E]guilty \[A]stains:
  Lose \[A]all their guilty \[D]stains,
  Lose \[A]all their guilty \[E]stains;
And \[A]sinners, plunged be\[D]neath that flood,
  Lose \[A]all their \[E]guilty \[A]stains.

\beginverse\versetitle
The ^dying thief re^joiced to see
  That ^fountain in his ^day;
And ^there may I, though ^vile as he,
  Wash ^all my ^sins a^way:
  Wash ^all my sins a^way,
  Wash ^all my sins a^way;
And ^there may I, though ^vile as he,
  Wash ^all my ^sins a^way.
\endverse

\beginverse\versetitle
Dear ^dying Lamb, Thy ^precious blood
  Shall ^never lose its ^power,
Till ^all the ransomed ^church of God
  Be ^saved, to ^sin no ^more:
  Be ^saved, to sin no ^more,
  Be ^saved, to sin no ^more;
Till ^all the ransomed ^church of God,
  Be ^saved to ^sin no ^more.
